# finder_website

Just a basic course finder for Hackathon

It will first retrieve CMPT subject from [here](http://www.sfu.ca/bin/wcm/course-outlines/?year=2021&term=summer&search=CMPT) then scrape infomation from 
outline and Rate My Professors website using BeautifulSoup

Should be runnable via Heroku [here](https://course-finder-sfu.herokuapp.com/)

## Things to consider
---
* Implement database to optimize loading time
* Change to scrapy to perform web scraping much more efficient and reliable
* Scrape a larger sfu courses data
* Use JS with html to create better API for website
